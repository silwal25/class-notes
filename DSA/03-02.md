## Traversing of binary trees

- **Pre-order**
	- Process the root R
	- Process the left subtree of R in preorder
	- Process the right subtree of R in preorder
- **Inorder**
	- Process the left subtree of R in inorder
	- Process the root R
	- Process the right subtree of R in inorder
- **Post order**
	- Process the left subtree of R in postorder
	- Process the right subtree of R in postorder
	- Process the root R
