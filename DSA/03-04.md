- Mathematic notation to describe the running time of an algorithm

- **Big "oh" notation:** Maximum number of steps to solve a problem
- **Big omega**: Minimum number of steps to solve a problem
- **Big thetha:** Average number of steps to solve a problem

Question: For the finction defined by f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 1. Prove/disprove the following

2. f(n) = O(n^3)
3. n^2 = O(f(n))
4. f(n) != O(n)
5. n^3 != O(f(n))
