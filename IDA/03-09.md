## Data reduction 1: Dimensionality reduction

- **Curse of dimensionality**
	- When dinmensionality increases, data becomes increasingly sparse
	- Density and distance between points, which is critical to clustering, outlier analysis becomes less meaningful
	- The possible combinations of subspaces will grow exponentially
- **Dimensionality reduction**
	-  Avoid the curse of dimensionality
	- Help eliminate irrelevant features and reduce noise
	- Reduce time and space required in data mining
	- Allow easier visualization
- **Dimensionality reduction techniques**
	- Wavelet transforms
	- Principal component analysis
	- Supervised and nonlinear techniques(feature selection)

#### Mapping data to new space
- Fourier transform
- wavelet transform

### Wavelet transform
- Decomposes a signal into different frequency subbands
	- Applicable to n-dimensional signals
- Data are transformed to preserve relative distance between objects at different levels of resolution
- Allow natural cluster to become more distinguishable
- Used for image compression
