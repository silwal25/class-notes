## Handling redundancy Data integration

- Redundant data occur often when integration of multiple databases is done
	- Object identification: the same attribute or object may jave different names in different databases
	- Derivable data One attribute may be derived attribute in another table
- Redundant attributes may be able to deteted by corellation analysis and covariance analysis
- Careful integration of the data from multiple sources may help reduce/avoid redundancies and inconsistencies and improve mining speed and quality

## Corellation analysis
- X^2 (chi square) test
	- X^2 = sigma(observed-expected)^2 / expected
- The larger value of chi square, the more likely the variables are related
- The cells that contribute the most to the chi square value are those whose actual count is very different from the expected count
- Corellation does not imply causality

- Corellation coefficient is also called pearson's product moment coefficient

#### Corellation(viewed as linear relationship)
- Correlation measures the linear relationship betweem objects
- To compute correlation, we standardize data objects A and B and then take their dot product
	- a(k) = a(k)-mean(A)/std(A)

#### Covariance
- Covariance is similar to correlation
	- Cov(A,B) = E((A-mean(A)(B-mean(B))

![Covariance](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/word-image29.png)

- **Positive covariance:** If Cov(A,B) > 0, then A and B both tend to be larger than their expected values
- **Negative Covariance:** If Cov(A,B) < 0, then if A is larger than its expected value, B is likely to be smaller than its expected value
- **Independence:** Cov(A,B) = 0, bit the converse is not true


## Data Reduction
- Obtain a reduced representation of the data set that is much smaller in voume but yet produces the same analytical results
- A database may store terabytes of data. Comples data analysis may take a very long time to run on the complete data set
- Some data dimensionality
	- Wavelet transforms
	- Principal components analysis
	- Feature subset selectionm feature creation
- Numerosity reduction
	- Regression and log linear models
	- Histograms clustering, samples
	- Data cube aggregation
- Data compression
