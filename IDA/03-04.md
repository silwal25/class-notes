## Data Mining

### Data Cleaning
- Data in real world is dirty. Lots of potentially incorrect data can be written
	- Incomplete: Lacking attribute values, etc
	- noisy: containing noice
	- inconsistent: Containing discrepencies
	- Intentional: Disguised missing data

#### Incomplete Data
- Data is not always available
	- eg, many tuples have no recorded vakye fir severak attributes
- Missing data may be due to
	- equipment malfunction
	- inconsistent with other recoeded data and this deleted
	- data not entered due to misunderstanding
	- certain data may not be considered important at the time of entry

**How to handle missing data?**
- Ignore the tuple
- Fill the missing value manually
- Fill it automatically with
	- a global constant
	- the attribute mean
	- attribute mean for all data belonging to the same class
	- Most probable value, using bayesian formula or decision tree


#### Noise
- Random error or variance in a measured variable
- May be due to:
	- Faulty instrument
	- data entry problems
	- technology limitations
- Other data problems
	- duplicate records
	- imcomplete data
	- inconsistent data

**How to handle noisy data**
- Binning
	- First sort data and partition into bins
	- then one can smooth by bin means, median or boundaries
- regression
	- smoothe bu fitting the data into regression functions
- clustering
	- detect and remove outliers
- combines computer and human inspection
	- detect suspicious values and check by human

### Data cleaning as  a process
- **Data discrepancy detection**
	- use metadata
	- check field overloading
	- check uniqueness rule, consecutive rule and null rule
	- use commercial tools
		- data scrubbing: using simple knowlede of the data to detect errors and make corrections.
		- data auditing: by analyzind data to discover rules and relationship to detect violators.
- **Data migration and integration**
	- Data migration and intefration
		- Data migration tools
		- ETL(extraction/transformation/loading) tools
	- Integration of the two processes
		- Iterative and interactive

### Data integration
- Data integration
	- Combining the data from multiple sources ino a coherent store.
- Schema integration.
	- Integrate metadata from different sources
- Entity identification problem
	- Identify real world entities from multiple data sources
- Decting and resolving data value conflicts

#### Handling redundancy in data integration
