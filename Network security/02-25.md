# Cipher
- Block cipher and stream cipher belong to the symmetric 

## Stream ciphers
- in stream cipher one byte is encrypted at a time while in block cipher 128 bits are encrypted at a time
- initially a kery will be supplied as input to pseudorandom bit generator and then it produces a random 8-nit output which is treated as keystream
- the resulted keystream will be of size 1 byte i.e. 8 bits
- Stream cipher followz tghe sequence of pseudorandom number stream
- One of the benefits of stream cipher os to make cryptanalysis more difficult

#### Known attacks
- known key attack
- known plain text attack
- brute force attack

#### Size of key in des is 56 bit
#### In AES there can be 128, 156 and 256

## Encryption
- Plain text an keustream procuces cipher text (Same keystream will be used for decryption)
- The plain text will undergo XOR operation with keystream bit bu bit and produces the cipher text
- Considerable benefit of a stream cipher is it requires few lines of code compared to block cipher

## EG:
## 10001
00001
--------
10000
--------

## Block cipher
- A block cipher is one that allows you to use a key to encrypt data in big ol groups (blocks) of a pre-determined size
- The plain text message will be broken down into smaller blocks of binary
eg: DES, 3DES, Blowfish


# Classical encryption techniques
## Symmetric cipher model

### Requirements
- Two requirements for secure use of symmetric encryption
	- A strong encryption alorgithm
	- A secret key known only to sneder/receiver
- Methematically have:
	- Y = Ex(X)
	- X = Dx(Y)
- Assume encruptionb algorithm is known
- implies a secure channel to distribute key

### Cryptology
It has two parts, crytographu which focuses on creating secret codes and cryptanalysis which is the study of the cryptographic algorithm amd rhe breaking of those secret code

## Cryptanalysis attacks
- KPA
- CPA
- COA
- MTM
- ACPA

## Caesar cipher
- Earliest known substitution cipher
- bu Julius Caesar
- first attested use in military affairs
- replaces each letter by 3rd letter

#### Cryptanalysis of caesar cipher
- Only have 26 possible ciphers
- couly simply try each in tyrn

### Modified Caesar cipher
- An aphabet can be replaced by any letter not only by 3rd one

#### Algorithm to break the modified caesar cipher

## Monoalphabetic cipher
- Rather tham just shifing the alphabet, could shuffle the letters arbitrarily

## Playfair cipher
- Multiple letters are encrypted
- Invented by charles wheatstone

- A 5x5 matrix of letters based on a keyword
- fill in the letters of keywords without duplicates
- fill rest of the matrix with other letters

#### Method
- If a pair is a repeated letter, insert a filler like X
- if both letters fall in same row, replace each with letter to the right
- If both letters fall in the same column then replace each with the letter below it
- Otherwise each letter is replaced by the letter in the same row and in the column of the other letter of the pair
 

#### Population of the key
Suppose the key and plain text is given,

## Question: key my name, plain text "cryptography class"
