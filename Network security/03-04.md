## Hill cipher

- Use an n=x matrox M. Encrypt by breaking the plaintext into blocks of length n (padding with x if needed) and multiplying each by M (mod 26)

Plain text: Network

NE: n=13 and e = 4

| 2   | 3   |     | 13  |     | 38  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 3   |     | 4   |     | 25  | 

38%26 = 12 = M
25%25 = 25 = Z

Cipher of plain text
NE=MZ

#### Similarly:
TW:
T = 19 and W = 22

| 2   | 3   |     | 19  |     | 104 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 3   |     | 22  |     | 85  |


104%26= 0
85%26 = 7

0 = A and 7 = H

TW = AH

## Transposition techniques
- It is a cryptographic technique that converts the pkain text to copher text by performing permutations on the plain text
- This hide the message by rearranging the letter order

#### Some transposition techniques
- Rail fence cipher
- Columnar transposition 
	- Simple columnar transposition
	- double columnar transposition
- Vernam cipher

### rail fence cipher
- In this method plain text is writte downwards on rails of fence starting a new column when bottom is reached
- **Algorithm:**
	- First write down plain text message as a sequence of diagonals
	- read the plain text written in first step as a sequence of rows

### Simple Columnar technique
- In this method the message is written in rows of fixed length and read out column by column
- Column are selected in some scrabled order.
- The number of column are defined by the length of the key

**Algorithm**
- Write the plain text message row by row in a rectangle of predefined size
- read the message column by column according to the selected order thus obtained message is a cipher text
