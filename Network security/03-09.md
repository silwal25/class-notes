## Steganography
- Steganography is the art and science of embedding secret message in a cover message in such a way that no one, apart from the semder amd intended recipient suspects the existence of the message
- Hides existence of message
	- Using only a subset of letters/words in a longer message marked in some way
	- using invisible ink
	- hiding in lsb in graphic image or sound file
- has drawbacks
	- High overhead to hide relaively few info bits

### Cryptography vs steganography

- **Cryptography** changes the information to cipher text whick cannot be understood without a decryption key. So, if someone were to intercept this encrypted message, they could easily see that some form of encryption is applied
- **Steganography** is the technique to hide the existence of communication


## Module 2: Modes of Operation

- ECB: Electronic code book
- CBC: CIpher block chaining
- CFB: cipher feed back
- OFB: output feedback
- CTR: Counter


### Electronic code block
- Message is broken into independent blocks which are encrypted
- Each block is a value whick is substituted. like a codebook, hence name
- Each block is encoded independently of the other blocks
- Uses: secure transmission of single values

![ECB scheme](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fslidetodoc.com%2Fchapter-8-encipherment-using-modern-symmetrickey-ciphers-1%2F&psig=AOvVaw1-raf8CreRb5Hnb9KTP8AQ&ust=1646908398159000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCPjKu4bquPYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

- **Strength:** It is simple
- **Weakness:** 
	- Repetitive information contained in the plaintext may show in the cipher text, if aligned wuth blocks
	- If the same message is encrypted(with the same key) and sent twice, their ciphertext are the same.
- **Typical applications:**
	- Secure tranmissions of short pieces of information

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Warning: You are running an unofficial Flatpak version of Visual Studio Code !!! |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please open issues under: https://github.com/flathub/com.visualstudio.code/issues


This version is running inside a container and is therefore not able
to access SDKs on your host system!

To execute commands on the host system, run inside the sandbox:

  $ flatpak-spawn --host <COMMAND>
  
To make the Integrated Terminal automatically use the host system's shell,
you can add this to the settings:

  {
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash",
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
        "bash": {
          "path": "/usr/bin/flatpak-spawn",
          "args": ["--host", "--env=TERM=xterm-256color", "bash"]
        }
    }
  }

This flatpak provides a standard development environment (gcc, python, etc).
To see what's available:

  $ flatpak run --command=sh com.visualstudio.code
  $ ls /usr/bin (shared runtime)
  $ ls /app/bin (bundled with this flatpak)

To get support for additional languages, you have to install SDK extensions, e.g.

  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.dotnet
  $ flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.golang
  $ FLATPAK_ENABLE_SDK_EXT=dotnet,golang flatpak run com.visualstudio.code

You can use

  $ flatpak search <TEXT>

to find others.
